# Sleeping Dragon Sign 

Arduino project that illuminates a "Warning, Sleeping Dragon" sign with three different strands of NeoPixels. 

1. 2 NeoPixles to illuminate the Warning symbols
2. 3 NeoPixels to illuminate the "Warning!" text
3. 5 NeoPixels to illuminate the "Sleeping Dragon" text

Each strand does a different thing repeatedly. This is a work in progress.
